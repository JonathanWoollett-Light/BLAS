### What?

A better simpler website to illustrate BLAS operations.



### Why?

The current website is an artifact straight outta 2000.
I mean just look at it: https://www.netlib.org/blas/

### Who?

This is for people with some understanding of BLAS operations, it is meant more as a reference than a tutorial.

### Help wanted!

I'm just some programmer who does some GPU compute stuff with linear algebra, I know little to nothing about most of these functions.
This site is very much a WIP, so please submit as many pull requests as you can tolerate.
